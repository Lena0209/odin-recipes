    <ul>
        <li>6 Pieces of Boneless Chicken Thigh with the skin on (cut into 1-inch cubes)</li>
        <li>2.5 Tbsp of Soy Sauce </li>
        <li>3 Tbsp of Chinese Cooking Wine (optional) </li>
        <li>2 Minced Garlic ~ 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp of Five Spice Powder</li>
        <li>One Large Egg </li>
        <li>3.5 Tbsp of Rice Flour</li>
        <li>1.5 Cup of Thai Basil </li>
        <li>2 Cup of Tapioca Starch </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken with soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine (optional), minced garlic, and Five Spice Powder for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, add in 3.5 tbsp of rice flour and one egg and mix. You want a wet batter consistency.</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken with Tapioca Starch and let it sit for 5-7 minutes to prevent the coating from falling off. </li>
        <li>In a pan, add in oil and turn the heat to medium-high. Once the oil is hot, add in the Thai Basil and fry it for 30 seconds â€“ 1 minute or crispy. This will help with fragrant oil. </li>
        <li>Next, add the chicken and fry the chicken for 4-5 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Optional, but highly recommend, turn the heat to high and double fry the chicken for 1 minute and the basil for 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle on the seasoning mix(chili powder, paprika, five-spice powder, white pepper, garlic powder, and salt) and ENJOY!!</li>
    </ol>
